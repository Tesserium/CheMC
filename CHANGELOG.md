### 6.0-α53
- Hotfix for β5. Tweaked "Raw Iron Block" to "Siderite Block"

### 6.0-β5
- Added all stuff in β4 to deepslate.
- Added more recipes.
- Raw Iron Block now drops 18 packs of siderite powder

### 6.0-β4
- Iron ore (now called "siderite") now drops at most 12, on average 7.2 siderite powders. 9 siderite powders form a pack of siderite powder. 2 packs of siderite powder and 1 pack of coal powder can craft a "Siderite Powder Mixed with Coal". On smelting this mixture undergo the reaction of 2FeCO₃ + C --heat-> 2Fe + 3CO₂ and forms raw iron. Melt the raw iron again forms iron ingot.
- Known bugs/non-scientific stuff: smelting siderite items will yield Fe₂O₃. It has no texture and no use.

Appendix:<br>
The possibility of each dropping amount of siderite powder of iron ore is in the following table:
| Amount | Possibility (in %) |
| ------ | ----------- |
| 0 | 0.00168 |
| 1 | 0.03020 |
| 2 | 0.24914 |
| 3 | 1.24571 |

### 6.0-β3
- Iron shovel and hoe now rusts at the same speed as iron pickaxe.

### 6.0-β2
- Iron axe now rusts. Ticks are (in ticks): 48000, 45000, 42000, 36000, 32000.
- Tweaked the rusting time of unrusted iron pickaxe from 42000 to 44000 ticks.
- Updated README.md to make it look a little better.

### 6.0-β1
First notable milestone! Changes:
- Iron pickaxe now rusts. It has six steps: unrusted, slightly rusted, mildly rusted, moderately rusted, heavily rusted and completely rusted. The first 5 steps needs following time before entering the next step (in ticks): 42000, 40000, 36000, 32000, 24000. 
- Added triirontetraoxide ingot and dust. 1 ingot <-> 9 dusts; 8 dusts round + 1 iron ingot in the middle -> 1 netherite scrap; 1 netherite ingot -> 1 triirontetraoxide ingot. Currently doesn't have any usefulness.
- Also has triitontetraoxide sword but can only be obtained by command or creative mode; triitontetraoxide tools doesn't have a texture for now and cannot be obtained in survival mode.
- Currently has English and Chinese translation.
