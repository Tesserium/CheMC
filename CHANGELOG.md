### 6.0-β1
First notable milestone! Changes:
- Iron pickaxe now rusts. It has six steps: unrusted, slightly rusted, mildly rusted, moderately rusted, heavily rusted and completely rusted. The first 5 steps needs following time before entering the next step (in ticks): 42000, 40000, 36000, 32000, 24000. 
- Added triirontetraoxide ingot and dust. 1 ingot <-> 9 dusts; 8 dusts round + 1 iron ingot in the middle -> 1 netherite scrap; 1 netherite ingot -> 1 triirontetraoxide ingot. Currently doesn't have any usefulness.
- Also has triitontetraoxide sword but can only be obtained by command or creative mode; triitontetraoxide tools doesn't have a texture for now and cannot be obtained in survival mode.
