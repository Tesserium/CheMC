/*
 * `net.minecraft.item.Item.inventoryTick(ItemStack, World, Entity, int,
 * boolean)` exists, however only players call it, and modded inventories may or
 * may not. 
 * To solve this 
 * 1. store a timestamp in NBT 
 * 2. In the inventoryTick override check if World.getTime() is greater than or equal to this timestamp
 * 3. If yes, replace the stack with the oxidised version using the entity and slot index parameters 
 * 4. Additionally, if an item has no oxidation timestamp,
 * generate one
 * 
 * Unfortunately it's not possible to have the stack oxidise while in a
 * non-ticking inventory, but with this approach the oxidation state will be
 * corrected as soon as it enters a ticking inventory.
 * 
 * For 2 you'll need to
 * 1. instanceof check for PlayerEntity
 * 2. Cast so you can use PlayerEntity.getInventory() 
 * 3. Call Inventory.setStack() using that
 *
 * Additionally similar approach with InventoryOwner might catch some modded entities, if they happen to tick their inventories
 * I've had reason to write an entity that does that before
