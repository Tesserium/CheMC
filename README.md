# CheMC
A mod that aims to make Minecraft as scientific as possible. 

# Modifications
- All 4 iron tools rusts.
- Iron ore (now called "siderite") now drops at most 12, on average 7.2 siderite powders. 9 siderite powders form a pack of siderite powder. 2 packs of siderite powder and 1 pack of coal powder can craft a "Siderite Powder Mixed with Coal". On smelting this mixture undergo the reaction of 2FeCO₃ + C == 2Fe + 3CO₂ and forms raw iron. Melt the raw iron to form iron ingot.

Calculate the probability (of the deepslate ones) with C(5,r)\*0.4<sup>r</sup>\*(1-0.4)<sup>5-r</sup>, where `r` is the amount of items dropped. Replace 0.4 with 0.42 to calculate for normal ones.
