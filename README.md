# CheMC
A mod that aims to make Minecraft as scientific as possible. 

# Modifications
- All 4 iron tools now rusts.
- Iron ore (now called "siderite") now drops at most 12, on average 7.2 siderite powders. 9 siderite powders form a pack of siderite powder. 2 packs of siderite powder and 1 pack of coal powder can craft a "Siderite Powder Mixed with Coal". On smelting this mixture undergo the reaction of 2FeCO₃ + C --heat-> 2Fe + 3CO₂ and forms raw iron. Melt the raw iron to form iron ingot.

The possibility of each dropping amount of siderite powder is in the following table:
| Amount | Possibility (in %) |
| ------ | ----------- |
| 0 | 0.00168 |
| 1 | 0.03020 |
| 2 | 0.24914 |
| 3 | 1.24571 |
| 4 | 4.20427 |
